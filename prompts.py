# 1) Two Sum (Array)
#    Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an
#    integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum
#    up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any
#    order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return
#    an empty array.


# 2) Validate Subsequence (Array)
#    Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether
#    the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
#    A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array
#    but that are in the same order as they appear in the array.For instance, the numbers


# 3) Sorted Squared Array (Array)
#    Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted in ascending order
#    and returns a new array of the same length with the squares of the original integers also sorted
#    in ascending order.


# 4) Tournament Winner (Array)
#    There's an algorithm tournament taking place in which teams of programmers compete against each other
#    to solve algorithmic problems as fast as possible. Teams compete in a roundrobin, where each team
#    faces off against all other teams. Only two teams compete against each other at a time, and for each
#    competition, one team is designated the home team, while the other team is the away team. In each
#    competition there's always one winner and one loser; there are no ties. A team receives 3 points if it
#    wins and 0 points if it loses. The winner of the tournament is the team that receives the most amount
#    of points.


# 5) Non-Constructable Change (Array)
#    Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins in your possession,
#    write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (the minimum sum of money) that you
#    cannot create. The given coins can have any positive integer value and aren't necessarily unique
#    (i.e., you can have multiple coins of the same value)
#    For example, if you're given [1,2,5], the minimum amount of change that you can't create is 4


# 6) Transpose Matrix (Array)
#    You're given a 2D array of integers matrix. Write a function that returns the transpose of the matrix.
#    The transpose of a matrix is a flipped version of the original matrix across its main diagonal
#    (which runs from top-left to bottom-right); it switches the row and column indices of the original
#    matrix.You can assume the input matrix always has at least 1 value; however its width and height are
#    not necessarily the same.


# 7) Find the Closest Value in BST (Binary Search Tree)
#    Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a target integer value and returns the
#    closest value to that target value contained in the BST. You can assume that there will only be one
#    closest value. Each BST node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. A
#    node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value is
#    strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the
#    values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves or
#    none / null .


# 8) Branch Sums (Binary Search Tree)
#    Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns a list of its branch sums ordered from
#    leftmost branch sum to rightmost branch sum. A branch sum is the sum of all values in a Binary
#    Tree branch. A Binary Tree branch is a path of nodes in a tree that starts at the root node and
#    ends at any leaf node. Each Binary Tree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right
#    child node. Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves or None null.
